# Readable Project

Welcome to the readable forum thingy!

I learned a lot about react/redux during the project, so some code is better
than others :)

    - Review instructions from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
    - You will need to check out this repo
    - cd api_server
    - npm install
    - node server

- Get this project running:
    - Clone this repo
