# Readable Project

Welcome to the readable forum thingy!

I learned a lot about react/redux during the project, so some code is better
that others :)

## Install and Running:
- Make sure api_server is running
- npm install
- npm start

## Acknowledgements
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
